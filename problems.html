		<h1>Problems</h1>
			Search for solutions in our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sovereigncomputing">discussion group</a>.<br/>
			<br/>
			If you can't find a solution after thoroughly searching the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sovereigncomputing">discussion group</a>, join the group and send us an email with a descriptive, specific subject. We will be glad to help.

		<h3>Third Party Criticism</h3>

			Find recent criticism on Sneer by other people using this <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q="sneer+can+improve"&tbs=qdr:y'>Google search</a>.<br/><br/>
			We value feedback <b><i>a lot</i></b>. If you post criticism about Sneer, please include the phrase <b>"Sneer can improve"</b>. This will help people find your post using the link above.<br/><br/>
			Please be constructive and give concrete examples of what you are talking about.

		<h3>Security</h3>

			Security is built into Sneer from the beginning:<br/>
				<ul>
					<li>Each brick runs in its own classloader so that it can be sandboxed using the Java security model. However, Sneer is NOT sandboxing them yet.</li>
					<li>All data communication passes through a single point in the code, allowing data encryption to be added when that becomes a priority.</li>
					<li>Each Sneer user has their own "Seal" (a SHA512 hash of an ECDSA256 public-key) for authentication, although it is NOT being enforced right now.</li>
				</ul>

			So, simply DO NOT run 3rd party bricks you don't trust and do not use Sneer to host or transfer security-critical information just yet.

		<h3>GUI Freeze-ups</h3>

			The GUI is not stable yet and will occasionally freeze-up. We are pushing the limits of existing GUI frameworks, which are mostly geared toward having the GUI initiate events and not asynchronously reacting to events in the system. Swing and GUI experts in general are very welcome to the project.<br/>
