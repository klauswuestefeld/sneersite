						Want to share songs you and your friends wrote? You guys have cool tracks that are public domain?<br />
						<br />
						Sneer will download random tracks from your friends to surprise you.<br />
						<br />
					<p>
						As soon as you begin to listen to the tracks that have been downloaded already, three icons will appear below under the player control buttons. 
						Click on the “Me Too” icon (the happy face) if you like the song and want Sneer to download similar tracks. 
						Click on the “Meh” icon (the face showing its tongue) if you don’t like the song and want Sneer to delete downloaded track, but do not want to influence your preferences. 
						And click on the “No Way” icon (the cringing face) if you do not like the song, so that Sneer deletes the downloaded track and does not download similar ones.
					</p>
					<img id="musicinboxpreferencespic" src="resources/imgs/music-inbox-preferences.png" alt="" />
					<p>
						Using No Way technology, Sneer will actually <i>learn</i> about your musical taste! 
						The more tracks you download from your friends, the better the software will become at determining your preferences and download songs you like better.
						<br /><br />
						Click on <i>Menu</i> &rsaquo; <i>Music</i> to open the player.
					</p>
					<img id="musicPic" src="resources/imgs/music.png" alt="" />
					<p>
						The player will appear at the bottom of the Sneer window. Hover over the player and click on  <i>Music</i> &rsaquo; <i>Choose Tracks Folder...</i>
					</p>
					<img id="tracksFolderPic" src="resources/imgs/tracksFolder.png" alt="" />
					<p>
						Choose the folder with the tracks which you want Sneer to share with your friends. All subfolders will be shared as well.
					</p>
					<img id="tracksFolderScreenPic" src="resources/imgs/tracksFolderScreen.png" alt="" />
					<p>
						OK! Now you have a drop-down list with all the subfolders in the folder you 	had selected earlier as well as one <i>&lsaquo;Inbox&rsaquo;</i> option. 
						This inbox option contains the tracks Sneer has downloaded from your friends. The counter (beside the inbox option) will increase for every friend’s track received. 
					</p>
					<img id="drop-downPic" src="resources/imgs/drop-downScreen.png" alt="" />
					<p>
						To listen to your tracks, choose a folder from the drop-down list and your songs will begin to play.
					</p>
					<img id="playerPic" src="resources/imgs/player.png" alt="" />
					<p>
						Great! Now you can listen to your own music folders using Sneer, but before you can share any of your tracks, you must allow the program to map them all (this process can take a while).
					</p>
					<p>
						To monitor the mapping task and any other tasks Sneer is running, check the Log Console by clicking on <i>Menu</i> &rsaquo; <i>Open Log Console</i>
					</p>
					<img id="openLogConsolePic" src="resources/imgs/openLogConsole.png" alt=""  />
					<p>
						The following screen will open, logging Sneer’s events.
					</p>
					<img id="logConsolePic" src="resources/imgs/logScreen.png" alt="" />
					<p>
						As soon as Sneer is done mapping, it will begin to download songs from your online friends. If you want to follow the progress of your downloads, go to <i>Menu</i> &rsaquo; <i>Downloads...</i>
					</p>
					<img id="downloadsPic" src="resources/imgs/downloads.png" alt="" />
					<p>
						Label the songs in your inbox in order for Sneer to download more songs and cater to your preferences.
