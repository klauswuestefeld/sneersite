		<h3>What is Sneer?</h3>

 			Sneer is a free and open source sovereign computing platform. It runs on your machine (like Skype or Firefox) using the Java VM. It enables you to:<br/>
				<ul>
					<li>Create your personal cluster by sharing hardware resources (CPU, disk space, network bandwidth) with your friends.</li>
					<li>Host your own social network, information and media.</li>
					<li>Create sovereign applications and share them with others.</li>
					<li>Download and run sovereign applications created by others, way beyond your wildest dreams.</li>
				</ul>
			You can do all these things directly with your peers, in an autonomous, sovereign way, without depending on online service providers such as email providers, Google, Facebook, etc.<br/>

		<h3>What is Sovereign Computing?</h3>

			Sovereign computing is peer-to-peer social networking taken to extremes. It is the freedom to share information and hardware resources with your friends any way you please. <a href="http://www.advogato.org/article/808.html">Learn more.</a><br/>
			Sovereign applications are open source, peer-to-peer, social network applications.<br/>

		<h3>Is Sneer Ready to Use?</h3>

			Ready:<br/>
				<ul>
			    	<li>Creating and editing Snapps (sovereign applications) using Eclipse.</li>
			    	<li>Connecting to your friends.</li>
			    	<li>MP3 music sharing with amazing “No Way” technology. :)</li>
			    	<li>Shouting to the Wind (public chat).</li>
			    </ul>

			Currently under development:<br/>
				<ul>
			    	<li>Peer Backups - Share your and your friends’ terabytes for free encrypted backups rather than paying 10 bucks a month for 50GB on Dropbox.</li>
    				<li>Brick Sharing - Download and run new and updated Snapps from within Sneer itself.</li>
    			</ul>

			Future Development:<br/>
				<ul>
	    			<li>CPU and network bandwidth sharing.</li>
    				<li>[Your application goes here]</li>
    			</ul>

		<h3>Is Sneer YASN (Yet Another Social Network)?</h3>

			There is only ONE human social network and it is composed of all human relationships in real life.<br/>
			Facebook, Orkut, LinkedIn and the like are not social networks, therefore. They are only partial, online misrepresentations of the same singleton human social network.<br/>
			Sneer does not take your data away from you to keep in some supposedly safe place. It just helps YOU control your own social network, your own data and how you will be share it with others.<br/>

		<h3>Why Java?</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>The Java VM supports many languages other than Java, including JRuby, Jython and Scala.</li>
				<li>The Java community is strong, the VM and the compiler are free software and portability is unmatched.</li>
				<li>Java offers a strong security model, and Sneer must be able to run code you decide to download from your peers in a secure sandbox.</li>
			</ul>
